#### Summary
The goal of this project is to test whether Elastic Net regularization might improve current regularization methods used in text classification. We conduct this analysis in the context of identifying potentially unreliable news articles. As a text classification problem, feature engineering includes several natural language processing techniques that are outlined in the writeup. We focus on logistic regression, which has performed well in other text classification problems. Our work compares elastic net with ridge, lasso regularization methods, and explores potential variation between these methods with respect to our highdimensional data.
